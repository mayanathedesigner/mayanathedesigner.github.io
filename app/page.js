            from there, I put on the canvas everything that seemed like a good idea (you would laugh). we'll focus on my process of choosing the navigation for the app. in fact, the ux designer in me was born during this project. once I started wanting to make it easier, there was no way to let it go. but the more I tried, the harder it got. and that's why I fell in love with this topic; it was a sign that the road ahead of me was challenging—which means fun

          clean design has my heart, and with that in mind, the buttons at the top started to annoy me. why have them there when the ones at the bottom lead to the same path? by removing them, I realized the users would not know where they were. so the text was needed. the trouble came from wanting the screen to be clean, right? instead of just icons, the text went into the buttons, and I also removed two buttons and added a menu

          from that point on, the necessity to build something that felt good to use, no matter the size of the device, became evident. the designs had been created to have a starting point for coding. however, when words like "simple," "intuitive," "user-friendly," and so on joined the mix, I got lost. it was much easier to create a good-looking, clean app, but delivering a good user experience demanded much more from me. every time a new idea materialized, I would also realize it would bring more difficulty. I felt trapped. trying to make it easier only made it harder. the following screens are a good example

                  at the time it didn't seem too hard to understand. but building the app with only personal use in mind doesn't make any sense. of course having more steps to complete a simple task didn't bother me—it's my app, it could have 10! nevertheless, the goal is for others to use it as well, a better navigation system was necessary. then, I got a better solution.

        it was the most beautiful vision ever, I swear. after being asked to try the app, without any further explanations, they got the point of it and moved through the app very easily. even my grandma didn’t have any problems touching a target. to use with one hand though, it’s hard to hit a note if it’s small and at the top of the screen. but i’m working on it. in the upcoming weeks, I'll have a full case study and would love to have you here to watch it come to life        </p>

            if you’re more experienced, you probably already know what I have just found out. both Android and IOS have functionalities designed to improve user experience on large devices. once enabled, they can pull down the top of the screen. however, on phones the size of an iPhone Pro Max, for example, this feature isn't sufficient. it’s still too arduous; the hand doesn’t reach the top buttons even when they’re not all the way at the top. for this reason, my quest continues. the best solution for now seems to be designing the app with very easy bottom navigation for any device
